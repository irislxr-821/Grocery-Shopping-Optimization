# Grocery-Shopping-Optimization
Tools: Python (Gurobi Package)
## Description
As a student at that time, I was struggle with how to find food in the cheapest and fastest way while maintaining the neccessary nutritions. This idea inspired me to start a optimization project deliver not just for me, but people with the same concerns a model that provides the lowest-cost grocery list per user by considering lifestyle factors such as desired nutritional intake and travel time.

## Objective
The basic model was built by minimizing the cost of purchasing grocery items and the cost of traveling to the grocery store, subject to transportation, nutrients, diversity, and allergy constraints. The objective of the model was that it would automatically determine one store the user should visit for groceries, as well as one recommended traveling mode to achieve the lowest cost. The later part, however, can also be pre-selected by the user. For our model, the user was assumed to reside on the campus of the University of Toronto, and thus, the origin of travel. The stores to be chosen are two Loblaws branches, two No Frills branches, one Metro branch, one Walmart branch, and one Grocery Gateway branch. The modes of transportation include driving, walking, biking, and public transport. The user is assumed to have an allergy to peanuts to demonstrate the modelâ€™s capability of excluding a particular type of ingredient.
